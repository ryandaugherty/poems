I put the book back on my shelf where it sat for years. \n\n\nI had a breakthrough at a certain point while getting older. I cried a lot, my mind was blown open, and I saw with new eyes. I picked up my dusty volume of Hafiz again, and he started to speak to me in a way that no one ever really has. These days Hafiz has become my patron saint of writing. The title of this website is a line from his poem, \"If God Invited you to a Party\".  \n\n\nI want you to be blessed by these poems. Enjoy them like a hot bath. Put them in your back pocket. Come back. \n\n\nWith Love,\n\nRyan Daugherty",
