I dig  
because your depth called for God   
root deep, from a deeper well   
  
I sing   
because you looked for a bird  
lifting soul and spirit upward  
  
I dance  
because you wanted to know  
the mathematics of the heart   
  
I rise  
because you sought nobility  
a lion's eye and voice within   
  
I wait   
because I know where you are going  
Beloved  
no matter thought   
no matter feeling  
no matter body displaced  
all travels  
transmuted, golden  
  
I rain  
because I only call   
for one drop   
in advance
