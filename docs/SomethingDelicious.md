something delicious is happening in you   
something wide open  
  
we live in a world of silence  
everything on a platter, holy  
here to help you  
  
oh my! oh my!   
did you feel the exquisite radiance of God pop up small again  
sun on trees  
birds like a Japanese postcard  
oh my! oh my!   
  
just stare at one spot for a time  
pretending the gold in your chest isn't   
everywhere  
in all things living  
One gushing abundance  
flowing over and through  
everywhere  
in you all that you are  
doorstep One   
  
something delicious is happening in you   
something wide open
