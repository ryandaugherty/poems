Reading my poems   
is like a small locker where   
I pull out bushels of barley   
rye and flax  
a bumper of string beans  
stakes of tomatoes   
boxes of brussels  
strawberry quarts  
lemons and sublime limes  
mandarins for gods  
a tree of dates   
a kumquat   
rolling out across the floor   
  
I’m always surprised   
to bring out what’s been growing  
\  \  in your fields   
\  \  for years
