The kingdom of heaven:  
Always a suggestion  
always keep it like a secret  
steal a hidden peach, eat it  
maybe  
eyes like newborn baby   
semi-soft murmurings   
angel amnesia story   
like maybe you’ve heard this  
billion-life treasure map  
petal-open happy collapse  
maybe you’ve heard  
of ampersand in man  
\  \  mind&body  
\  \  heart&gut  
\  \  kind&bold  
\  \  wise&funny  
\  \  zen&dance  
impossible nonsensicals  
all one-light-love fest  
some crazy new-agey Jesus  
rambled about  
maybe you’ve heard of love blowing everything up  
so good you’d never need a gun  
or unkind word   
again  
  
Always  
keep it like a secret   
Steal that peach sweet-eyed child  
eat it
