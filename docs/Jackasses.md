If the jackass in you  
befriended the jackass in me  
we would have no need   
to be  
  
We could invent so many beautiful animals together  
invite them for dinner  
dancing on table  
  
mice strike hot with fiddle and bass  
moles sing-sway at invincible pace   
noble lions listen, lady giraffes tell  
red-cheeked lemurs in conversation swell   
and God   
would knock on the door then  
with all her golden hedgehogs and squirrels  
suggesting we build an ark and set sail    
on some zany adventure
