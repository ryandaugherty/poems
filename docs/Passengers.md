If you are in the back hypnotized   
gazing into your phone  
I love you  
  
If you are in the middle fighting  
angry in the name of beliefs, politics, justice  
I love you  
  
If you are in the front standing   
anchoring Love, blessing all behind  
I love you  
  
What with all this  
groaning, shuddering, smoke  
it appears this plane is going down  
  
I promise you  
a gentle landing   
intact as Christmas bells
