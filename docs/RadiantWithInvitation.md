If God invited you to a party  
The place would be a lot like  
this earth. It would be this earth.   
  
Every human an adorned guest  
Special and esteemed  
Radiant with invitation  
  
the triggering circumstance or someone  
you wanted to disinvite  
like a dream you once had   
when all along there was nothing for it  
but to feel that  
  
And get back to the party
