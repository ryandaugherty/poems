I used to live in a hovel inside  
holes in the roof, a constant storm  
battering my walls  
pit, pat, trickle  
and shiver  
by a tiny sun of coal ever-burning at the grate   
  
Then Love came to town one night  
crept in and made love to me  
like two planets welding fission  
the stars averted their eyes:   
there came a “pop!"  
  
Now I'm building doorways with curving scrollwork  
stained glass of doves and lotus flower  
no roof yet, but the disco floor is going in next week  
  
I want you to come by   
And dance
