Whatever my eager fingers tap out  
That is what I am here for  
to sit with my old friend, the night  
sonarous with crickets  
vaporous blanket   
tucked   
forest of shade and shadow       
unending  
\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \ Tip-tap  
\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \ Tip-tap  
  
Raven poems from a reel of type  
Glide in love   
Unto my friend the night
