The Lord came one night   
for hugs and coffee  
we talked favorite Kendrick tracks  
Trump, yoga, global warming  
old Will Ferrell SNL skits that made us cry  
laughing   
  
He mentioned a favor  
Though he loved the fame  
what with being the Lord and all  
he wondered  
instead of a grand Savior entry   
the next time around  
if *I* wouldn’t mind taking his spot  
let everyone know they're signed up too  
every god-woman, god-man walking this golden world  
  
I told him   
Yes!
