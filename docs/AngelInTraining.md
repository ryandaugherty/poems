I have said goodbye to the Christian in me   
it served me well  
  
But a follower never becomes the Master  
always needs one more thing  
one more perfect contrition at communion   
always walks uncelebrated  
never finds the Daughter or Son of God   
Blooming in their own two feet  
  
Love has taught me better:  
Call me little king   
Servent of men   
Angel in training, these days  
  
I will return blessings  
that is what I do  
  
Each moment, each day whatever arises   
whoever I meet  
whatever passing thought   
floats into this luminous mind  
Turning   
the object  
the subject   
to Blessing:  
  
May you be blessed   
  
The earth is glad to join me then   
calling this bird or that to come  
God in the glimmering hills  
God in my breast  
and who would not find a nest, there   
Where all things have become:  
  
B  
e  
a  
u  
t  
i  
f  
u  
l  
  
Come join me   
Rebuild this world from the inside   
  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \out   
Reconstruct every stone, every creature, every human  
Where every thing is blessed, and nothing is cursed
