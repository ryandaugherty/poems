your only great reward in life   
is *you*  
love you  
love you each day  
  
your only great reward in life  
is *living*  
enjoy life  
enjoy each day  
  
and come sail with me again  
where greater waves arc inward crashing   
spinning us joy-ward  
into the saddle of God's eye,  
the setting sun
