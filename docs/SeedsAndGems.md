Poetry is for getting hands dirty  
two hands rooting in the earth  
for seeds and gems  
maybe losing your hands there too  
left planted, laughing   
  
A poetic predicament writing hands misplaced in fields, I hear Hafiz  
laughing  
  
The hands of the poet grow wild   
like the weeds of heaven  
forming homes for birds and women   
quieter and cooler than any religion  
a part-two mansion   
always better than the last   
  
the Lord claps and approves   
throws Hafiz a high-five  
as they listen to love grow  
in the garden  
as they listen to love grow  
in men
