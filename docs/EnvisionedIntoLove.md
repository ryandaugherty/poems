"Envisioned into Love"   
is a poem I lost   
falling asleep last night  
  
Hunt for words like a vapor puzzle  
pray to Hafiz of all saints   
for the love of pants, clothe me  
  
Didn’t it bring saxophone   
floating over morning lawn?   
  
Or coffee in perfect white cup  
steaming upturned worlds?   
  
But   
nothing like ever-buzzing  
nothing like God lapel-close   
\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \ over lawns and coffee  
\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  saying  
What might we do  
What might we get into  
on such a buzzing June?
