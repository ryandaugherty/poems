Put the needle  
on the record   
of your life   
  
Put the needle  
  
such music makes heaven's opera stop  
Vivaldi drop out with a screech  
such a beat makes all blue-sequined shoes   
scoot out  
runaway buttocks shimmer, preach  
  
Slide onto the jeweled dance floor  
Slide  
  
oh armadillos unknown  
spinning on tail   
before the Throne   
  
oh beat-box fox babies   
angels all on pins   
sunglassed buffaloes  
tapping hoofs  
across shins    
  
Saint Francis b-boying  
top rocking the floor  
your great grandma grinding booty  
center circle   
with the Lord  
  
Kenyan choirs chiming   
skating four on the floor   
conga-lining  
while gnomes thread drinks   
box-stepping the bar  
hummingbirds pull fiddle  
rock a lofted guitar      
  
Bowie gives up mixing  
throws headphones to the fray  
grabs Prince and starts Le Freaking   
like 70s L.A.    
  
the stars all transmit    
the star of heaven's frequency   
  
the stars all quiver  
in their own boom-boom shiver  
  
When you put the needle   
on the record   
of your life  
  
When you put the needle   
on the record   
of your life
