Notice the soundtrack that plays  
when God kisses your brow each morning  
  
such beautiful music makes nearly every thought go  
Poof  
as if you never needed many  
  
not with so many kisses of God  
  
kisses on crown  
where God must unlink from God  
bury lips deep where your baby scent dwells  
  
kisses on eyes  
molten touches each to each    
reborn with the eyes of love   
  
kisses on mouth  
honeyed kisses, lyrical sweet  
remain only a tuning fork for praise  
  
kisses on ears   
resonance knotting caverns deep  
unafraid to listen, feel again  
  
kisses soft on forearms   
kisses on finger tips  
open palms   
and the center of your chest  
  
Notice the soundtrack that plays  
when Love is in love with Love  
and so many kisses   
must be placed  
where you are
