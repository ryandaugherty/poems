When you are kind   
to yourself   
even complimentary
  
It’s like the Lord came down  
made his home in your garden  
Clothed himself in You   
You in Him  
clipping dahlias  
feeding hummingbirds  
turning a pool of love  
reciprocating  
Human God  
God Human  
in a neverending love affair   
where   
e\  v\  e\  r\  y\  \  t\  h\  i\  n\  g  
\  \  joins in  
\  \  praise
