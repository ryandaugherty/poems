I am  
God’s saxophone  
all collect, grammar phone home   
you play me wanton, dizzy   
stolen just behind the Throne  
  
How could God blame  
Madame pink cherry  
wailing soul  
upon the lane?   
  
Living address, God, same   
Living sane cherry cherry lane  
  
Riff with me/for me  
Living night breathe/blow through me   
Until pink sunrise God   
come calling on the lane  
knock-knocking wanting melting   
In  
such a sweet party threesome  
I am, me am, you some  
  
Where did you get address   
Arisen pyre?   
  
Where did you call collect  
Chariot fire?   
  
blown sweet home  
throne of throne  
God of voluminous hip  
shakes and moans
