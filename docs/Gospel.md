The Teacher came  
and whispered in my ear something so sweet and hot   
it could only be called  
beach party   
booty time  
plum pudding rhythm   
rhyme  
80s saxophone  
yellow-parakeeting sunshine  
all naked children gather  
messing on   
blueberry pie  
shame-faced oh my—  
Gospel  
   
the front-pew kind   
where you can’t not glory,   
groove and sway
