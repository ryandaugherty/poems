There is a divine female in you  
a divine male   
too  
  
Let them disrobe  
shake hands  
examine crevasses and corners   
play records  
sing chords, sing old showtunes  
try tap dance  
map bird migrations across the lazy Sunday sky   
and make hot love  
  
here in this divine garden   
for all the world to see
