Follow up the road a bit   
don’t mind if I plant my feet in a wide field    
as the Everything Tree of God  
olives and oranges on the same branch  
a rolling array of good things  
where all can perch and feed   
on a juicy tidbit, a star or two  
  
Graft your slender shoot to mine,   
so that you too become the Everything Tree  
  
we will make a spot for every royal bird   
all lost wings and hardened buds  
open and fill   
in our Sun
