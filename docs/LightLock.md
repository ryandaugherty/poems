You are the Light of the world,   
the Teacher said  
  
Like throwing angelic coronation dust into the crowd willy-nilly   
  
Who got it on them?   
If not you, my Dear.   
  
It takes a long spell  
of being terribly  
unreasonably  
achingly   
Kind   
\  \  \  to yourself  
to believe this  
  
There is no measurable act of faith greater  
  
But trust me,  
once this Light gets locked   
in your head  
you may find life  
passing around you charmed  
and a slow heart   
that will never lack a smile again
