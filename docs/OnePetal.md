You would be tired too if you were transforming into an angel  
  
Oh, I see you are  
  
I have a friend   
a radiant chameleon who lives in the almond grove  
if we went there  
he would hand down fruit from his trees  
scuttle up your arm with gifts  
pantomime with claws to ask  
if it would be quite alright  
to unfurl  
One petal   
from the thousand   
in your heart
