Leave all weapons at the door of your heart  
bludgeons of logic  
daggers of raised intonation   
vials of judgement   
an occasional flaming F-grenade   
for when you are in traffic   
  
Leave them rest

Pick them back up again  
for a good fight with God:   
throw a punch or two   
with all your heart, soul and mind  
because a universe where anger still exists   
  
God knows how to take it    
and always reaches around with blessings  
placing them in your back pocket  
These  
you are bound to want to give    
to your worst enemy
