If I am the light  
How interesting the darkness  
everywhere I go   
it disappears  
flits away from my crisping edges    
before I can examine    
ask about its day    
if it wants to come for tea    
or walk with me    
    
Or maybe I resolve to hold darkness in view    
Saying, yes *that* is me    
shadow simpatico    
I can feel    
    
Even then, so elusive    
dark butterfly     
religion of one     
I can’t quite hold    
    
Not with my perpetual burning
