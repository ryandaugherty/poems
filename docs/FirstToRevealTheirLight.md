If you don’t double-down   
on love today, who will?  
  
If you aren’t   
all in  
on blessing the world,  
who will break the spell?   
  
Here we are  
sitting at table  
Fistfuls of aces  
Radiant queens  
Noble kings   
wondering who will be first to reveal their light  
  
After a great deal of calculating  
I see all can win  
we just need a signal  
a wink across the table  
to lay out gospel:   
here my body  
here my heart    
here my soul  
oh let me show you   
how I double-down on love today
