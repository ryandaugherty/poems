Never not write a poem   
with your day  
Never not inscribe your lovely arms  
with care   
A slow firmament  
of washing dishes  
Putting on makeup  
Shaking hands  
Offering a fingertip in compliment  
one fingertip to trace the world   
as good  
  
There is no thought in doing so  
just you, a hidden master at shore  
dropping golden letters into a river’s flow  
   
And with so many days written  
consider a volume title   
like,   
*Act Great*  
      
<br>    
      
(Inspired by "Act Great" by Hafiz/Daniel Ladinsky)
