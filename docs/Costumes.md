God keeps reaching down to take my costumes off,   
I keep slapping her hand away  
    
I remember one taken off  
so painful, so good  
I loved myself  
for the first time   
  
But I can’t keep letting it happen  
what would I be then   
but naked, orbital   
freed from every concept my mind has known   
but Love
