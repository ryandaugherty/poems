Of late my mind is filling up with nice words   
like, "It's ok that you feel so. It's ok."  
  
ok meaning...  
oh I forget anyway  
  
But I know that *word*  
like the pull of a harp  
like a smiling vibration   
all shivering until it reaches the temple  
  
I know it like a womanly golden cord  
etching and swaying before me  
and a voice saying, "Come up!  
Climb, my Son!"
