I   
is an   
ear-tucked flower, holy   
  
I  
is a   
love-mystery like an open field  
  
I   
walk   
inside   
turning blank stones  
folding reed grass   
wending over streams   
beauty without name  
or need to know  
  
A love-mystery  
am I   
and sweet   
sweet like hills and rows   
recreated in the hour  
from where and how  
God paints   
foot and flower   
higher, by a golden hue
