Years ago a friend gave me *The Gift*, a book of Hafiz poems transliterated by Daniel Ladinsky. I browsed through and mostly liked them, though I suspiciously felt they were a little new-agey. I put the book back on my shelf where it sat for years. 

I had a breakthrough at a certain point while getting older. I cried a lot, my mind was blown open, and I saw with new eyes. I picked up my dusty volume of Hafiz again, and he started to speak to me in a way that no one ever really has. These days Hafiz has become my patron saint of writing. The title of this website is a line from his poem, "If God Invited you to a Party".  

I want you to be blessed by these poems. Enjoy them like a hot bath. Put them in your back pocket. Come back. 

With Love,
