It's no secret you require an extravagant love  
to free you from the madness  
that has grown thorny  
around your heart  
  
Let me take your hand  
and grant you an ever-flowing cup  
hummingbirds drink from  
  
Let me steal all your tears  
for the anvil  
reforge them as diamonds  
I place upon your sacred arms   
  
Let me call the dark whale  
from eons and depths  
to sing tunneled songs  
known of your nobility  
  
Let me be the magician   
pulling lesser constellations   
and articles of light  
from your every pocket  
  
Let me show you the wide moon  
how easy it is to make love to her  
how Hafiz still breaks his heart   
open, across the sky  
  
I will show you the love you seek   
  
Bring me your silver mirror  
the best one you have,   
for nothing  
nothing is too good  
to frame the Beloved
