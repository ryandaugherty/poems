Let’s win the lottery  
You and I  
  
Out your door,  
grass shimmering along a new blade   
trees stretch taunt, lifting leaves   
the tall sure sun comes around and around  
warming birds, saying   
come up hither  
for play   
you’ll have as much food as you want  
when you see my expansive view  
  
Where all things sing together  
in Love  
All things sing together   
in Praise  
  
How sweet your voice to join in too  
Let’s join and win this lottery too
