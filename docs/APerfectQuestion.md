If a human didn’t know  
they were God, dressed up  
could you blame them?   
  
would you instead offer   
a loving tone   
a perfect question  
from friend to friend   
that made everything   
seem ok  
Like, let's just hang  
  
in this old-wood living room  
Sunday afternoon jazz and coffee  
particulate thoughts fly along brush beats  
pondering  
  
What do I need, today?
