You are the living, walking dignity of God  
come here,  
let me look you in the eye  
Sovereign One  
  
You don’t have to achieve anything  
go faster  
be against anyone  
believe truly   
know another fact  
to embody your hot,  
unrepentant Light   
  
Walk straight and noble  
Say your own sweet name purely  
Be as you wish  
Act by the sacred ethic of Love   
Play in this vast playground    
and if an enemy arises   
remarks any slight against you  
rest assured, it has nothing to do with You  
Offer that Sovereign One:   
\  \  \  Thank you  
\  \  \  Is there anything more  
\  \  \  you have for me?    
  
Try those pants on for size, Beloved  
  
If that doesn’t cure you of feeling wounded  
I will have to write a better poem   
to recite  
maybe:    
  
<p style="text-align: center;">
I am </br>    
The Light  </br> 
The Light  </br> 
I am 
</p>
