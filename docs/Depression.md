Say you feel depressed  
as a god might  
who came down into this human form   
where depression was unavoidable  
where there was no way  
not to feel god-awful   
A void   
A pit so wide no reason could touch  
could point to, prescribe  
Or say, do this and feel better  
  
Just sit on your bed in your sweatshirt in darkness  
not even the light from your window  
light from your monitor  
comforter soft enough  
arms wide enough  
to dispel darkness   
  
Would you feel any compassion for that one?    
Would you feel any sweetness in the midst   
for a soul come down into this world   
where that happens?   
  
Honorary of darkness  
always deserving to feel better   
Love  
that one
