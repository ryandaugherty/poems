You have worked so hard  
at surviving   
at being approved  
your engine has gotten so revved  
at placing first  
at finding and enacting  
the correct rules  
getting down to the minutia   
striving for a life  
incrementally happier  
with a little less darkness  
  
You have blown the mind of God  
  
the confetti stars nightly pop, now  
and wheel across the blue   
Announcing  
nothing more,  
nothing more in this era  
  
You have done a great job  
  
All that's left to fix  
is to allow your heart  
the sacrament of weeping  
to kindly be led to a doorway  
where on the other side is a broad hearth  
piles and plates of soul food  
and everyone you love, cheering   
Well done my child  
Well done   
Well done  
Well done
